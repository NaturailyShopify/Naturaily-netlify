        is JAMstack?

      <div class="jamstack_left-more">
        JAMstack came alive to cover the pains of traditional workflows that rely on popular CMSes
        like Wordpress or Drupal. Changing the focus from the backend to a powerful frontend, it offers great load times and no troubles
        with system updates.

        JAMstack is a modern, revolutionary
        <br>
        way to build websites.
      </p>
      <p class="jamstack_right-desc">
        The JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs and Markup. It relies on the advantages of a
        static website, such as better performance and security, while still keeping the dynamic attributes of a database-oriented CMS without
        the database. As an outcome, you get a faster site that ranks well in Google and gives your visitors and outstanding experience.
      </p>
      <div class="jamstack_right-part">
        <p class="jamstack_right-part-name">JavaScript</p>
        <p class="jamstack_right-part-desc">The dynamic programming is handled by JavaScript, which runs entirely on the client. You can use any frontend library but, for most
          developers, it's Vue, React and Angular, as they have their own static site generators that can present data. There are also other
          static site generators available to use - with Gatsby, Hugo and Jekyll being just a few of them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="jamstack_right-part">
        <p class="jamstack_right-part-name">APIs</p>
        <p class="jamstack_right-part-desc">Any server-side and database processes, like content delivery or payment, require APIs, accessed with JavaScript. You can build custom
          solutions or go for third-party services.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="jamstack_right-part">
        <p class="jamstack_right-part-name">Markup</p>
        <p class="jamstack_right-part-desc">Markup is the daily bread and butter for content editors at static websites. During deployment, the templated markup is usually converted
          into HTML, CSS or JavaScript using a static site generator. Usually, a typical JAMstack build consists of a static site generator, a headless
          CMS for content management and a cloud hosting solution.</p>
