      Naturaily is only just over 30 people large, which means less people work
      on individual projects. A smaller team allows for everyone to know what
      their role is, for transparent communication and active participation, in
      making the best product possible. We build our products together. We don’t
      punish innovation and curiosity - we nurture it. We respect the expertise
      of our developers and always try to implement their best ideas into our
      projects. Every week brings new challenges, and every week, we work
      together to meet them.

        professional journey.

        I liked that the interview was straightforward and to the point. I
        immediately knew, what to expect, and what my role within the company
        would be. They weren't afraid to take a chance on a less experienced
        tester, and support my professional development. From day one I could
        count on the support of my team manager, who helped me navigate the job
        and explain more complicated processes.

        What makes us unique is our respect for individuality. We created an open
        and honest work environment that encourages everyone to be themselves. Our
        teams are a true mix of personalities, which makes for a productive and
        fun day at work. We value honesty and open communication between all team
        members. Everyone’s opinion is equally important and considered. We
        combine the best from both worlds - a friendly and relaxed atmosphere
        with strong work ethics.

        What made me choose Naturaily was the feeling that my opinion mattered

        about it!

      <blockquote>
        While I was still at University I took part in a group project competition.
        The premise was to build an application under the guidance of a real
        company. I was always passionate about Ruby on Rails and curious about
        Vue.js. Naturaily already worked with those frameworks so I applied to
        develop my project with them. With their help my team won the competition
        and I got a chance at a real internship. It’s been almost 2 years and I’m
        still here - I believe that speaks for itself.
