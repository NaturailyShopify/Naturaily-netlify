      <p>
        The goal of the project is performing activities aimed at intensifying the
        export operations of Naturaily on foreign markets, focusing on promising
        markets and the European Union. Market analysis and global trends indicate
        that the services planned to be promoted will allow the company to become
        recognizable on selected promising and EU markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturaily will take part in 6 trade and exhibition events in Israel,
        Japan, USA, Portugal and Finland as part of the project. Participation
        of Naturaily representatives in the IT / ICT industry promotion
        program will allow to promote IT services, in particular in the field
        of digital transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implementation of planned activities is expected to allow for the
        presence on foreign markets, including those not yet serviced, which
        will increase the number of clients served and will be reflected in
        the growing revenues of the company. Participation in fairs and
        meetings with potential partners will allow us to better understand
        clients' needs and gain a strong position on foreign markets.
